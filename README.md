# Project Title: Academic Article Topic Modeling Unsupervised Learning Algorithm Comparison

Tyler Kinkade

The goal of this project was to compare the effectiveness of unsupervised machine learning matrix decomposition algorithms for topic modeling real-world, imbalanced academic article abstracts in order to better understand the algorithms' strengths and weaknesses within this context. See the [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/tyknkd/academic-article-topic-modeling/blob/main/project.ipynb) for the complete report.
